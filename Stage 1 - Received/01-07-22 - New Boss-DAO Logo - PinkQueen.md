## Proposal Summary
*A short 1-3 sentence summary of your proposal.*

**Example 1:**

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the (ExampleASSET) floor in order to invest before a predicted value increase and receive (ExampleProject) token airdrops on (Date).

**Example 2:**

We propose the Boss DAO develop a discord bot to assign the “DAO NFT Owner” role to confirmed DAO members.


## Proposal Details
*Answer the following questions, and add any other relevant information.
What will the Boss DAO do?
Why should the Boss DAO do this? What does the DAO stand to gain? Include mathematical figures.
How will the treasury be involved? How much will be spent? How long will treasury funds be vested in the assets proposed?
Ideally, when should the vote on this proposal be held?*

**Example 1:**

We propose the Boss DAO utilizes 10,000 ADA of treasury funds to sweep the (ExampleASSET) floor. 

(ExampleProject) is an P2E project that has been traded for over 1.4m ADA on jpeg.store and will be released their P2E game soon. They recently released a trailer for the game which caused their floor to rise from 100 ADA to 175 ADA, a 75% increase in value. It is likely their value will increase more when the game fully releases.

Additionally, owners of the (ExampleProject) NFT will receive (ExampleProject) token airdrops on (Date). These tokens will be the in-game currency and will likely appreciate in value as the game matures and grows in popularity.

Up to 10,000 ADA will be used to buy the lowest priced (ExampleAsset) on jpeg.store. The purchased NFTs will be held until May 1st, exactly one month after their game & token release. At that point, the DAO will vote on whether to sell or continue holding the assets and/or token.
    
Ideally, the vote should be held the week of (Date)

**Example 2:**

We propose the Boss DAO develop a discord bot to assign the “DAO NFT Owner” role to confirmed DAO members.
This discord feature would allow owners to easily be identified during discord interactions, letting users see who is and isn’t a member of the DAO. Certain channels and features could be made accessible to DAO Members only, such as a private voting discussion channel.

The application should be developed so that it works with any Cardano NFT, asset, or policy ID. This would enable the bot to be easily used by other CNFT discords, helping to foster goodwill between the general CNFT community and the Boss DAO.

This proposal will not require funds from the treasury. The vote could be held at any point.
